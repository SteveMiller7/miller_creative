My website presents Miller Creative Graphic Designer. Based in Auchterarder, Perthshire, Scotland. Users will be 
able to find information on services I offer, make a purchase in the shop, create an account, make an enquiry and sign up to receive updates and offers. 
The site will contain featured work from past jobs which will be refreshed on a regular basis.
Users will be able to amend their account information as required. 

This is a responsive full stack data model web application structured using Django and Bootstraps and featuring authentication and permissions features.  

Contact information can be found on the contact page under the contact form. Links to social media pages are in the footer.
Site navigation is via the off canvas menu as well as nav links at the bottom of each page.

Aesthetically, I wanted it minimal, black and clean. I like the use of opacity boxes for text backgrounds and used full height background images
which look great.

# Website Layout

The wireframe layouts were created using Adobe Illustrator. 
It has been desinged to be clean, slick, minimal, professional and as user friendly as possible with the use of simple site navigation links.
Accessibility has been carefully considered with the use of cointrasting colours for borders and font colours. Alt text equivalents for the visually immpared have also been included. 
The site is responsive for all screen sizes and tailored to suit each. The user experince will be smooth and satisfying accros all devices.

# Aesthetics

The overall look of the site was created with the aim of being clean, slick, professional, modern and black.

A black theme was chosen to match the brand styling of the bsuiness. I customised background images with photoshop and used customised mockups throughout 
the site to advertise my work. 

I wanted to add little aesthetically pleasing features to catch the eye so I included a rotating company logo in the top left of the site.
I also included a parallax image in the index page and full background images around the diffefrent pages of the site.

I really like the look of content opacity backgrounds over the top of background images so I have included this throughout.

## Colour Palette
- Black
- White
- Olive Hex #B9BD86

## Fonts
- Open Sans - Google Fonts

## Images

Adobe Stock licensed images were used for some backgrounds around the site.

Custom images made up from my previos work were used for backgrounds, examples and placeholders.

One image that I used in a few places was my compliation of some past logos. I thought this was a good way to display my work as much as possible.
