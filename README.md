My website presents Miller Creative Graphic Designer. Based in Auchterarder, Perthshire, Scotland. Users will be 
able to find information on services I offer, make a purchase in the shop, create an account, make an enquiry and sign up to receive updates and offers. 
The site will contain featured work from past jobs which will be refreshed on a regular basis.
Users will be able to amend their account information as required. 

This is a responsive full stack data model web application structured using Django and Bootstraps and featuring authentication and permissions features.  

Contact information can be found on the contact page under the contact form. Links to social media pages are in the footer.
Site navigation is via the off canvas menu as well as nav links at the bottom of each page.

Aesthetically, I wanted it minimal, black and clean. I like the use of opacity boxes for text backgrounds and used full height background images
which look great.
